# CloneableCars

CloneableCars is a simple Java application that demonstrates the use of the Prototype Design Pattern. We simulate a car dealership system that can clone popular car models and customize specific attributes.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main Java classes:

- **Car:** This is our `Cloneable` class. It represents a car that can be cloned. The `Car` class has attributes such as brand, model, color, engine type, price, and availability status, and contains methods to clone itself and display its details.

- **CarDemo:** This class contains our `main` method. Within this method, we create an instance of the `Car` class, clone it, and modify attributes of the cloned object.

## How to Run

To run this project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Navigate to the `CarDemo` class.
4. Run the `main` method in the `CarDemo` class.

The console should display the details of the original `Car` object and its cloned copy with modified attributes.

## Enjoy Coding and Cloning Cars!
